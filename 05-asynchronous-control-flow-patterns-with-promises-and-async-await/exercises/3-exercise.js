// Producer-consumer with promises: Update the TaskQueuePC class
// internal methods so that they use just promises,
// removing any use of the async/await syntax.

// Beware of the recursive Promise resolution memory leak!

// Answer: Haven't found TaskQueuePC in the book.
// So this exercise was skipped.
