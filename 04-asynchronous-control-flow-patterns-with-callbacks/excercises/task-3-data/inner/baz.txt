In modern pop culture, Batman stands apart from many superheroes because of his moral complexity. He operates on the edge of the law, constantly questioning whether his methods are justified. Gotham’s criminals are often reflections of his own trauma, making every confrontation deeply personal. Batman’s refusal to kill is not a simple rule but a fragile line he must protect at all costs. If he crosses it, he risks becoming what he fights against. This internal struggle makes Batman compelling: he is not invincible, but persistent, proving that willpower and principles can rival even the most terrifying villains.
